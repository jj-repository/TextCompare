ICON PLACEHOLDER

To build the desktop executables with an icon, please add a 512x512 PNG file named "icon.png" to the root directory.

You can create an icon using any image editor or online tool. The icon should represent the TextCompare application (e.g., a document comparison symbol, diff symbol, or text comparison visual).

If no icon.png is provided, Electron will use the default icon.

Recommended icon specifications:
- Format: PNG
- Size: 512x512 pixels (will be automatically resized for different platforms)
- Transparent background (optional)
- Simple, clear design that works at small sizes
